<li><strong>Friendship requires commitment. It requires love and patience, and my friend, you have shown me that. You stuck with me when I was facing troubling signs or when my so-called other friends bailed on me. I am proud to call you my best friend because you are the one who understands me the most.</strong><br /></li>
<li>I feel blessed and filled with joy to have a friend like you in my life. You are always the first one to congratulate me whenever I find success in anything and the first one to lend a hand when I am in trouble. You are my life advisor, who has guided me through the tough situations in my life. I would have been so lost had it not for your constant support.</li>
