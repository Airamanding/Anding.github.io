<p> Best friends represent the purest form of friendship. Your best friend is someone who you might have met yesterday, yet you feel as though you have known him/her forever. And the beautiful thing about best friends is: They understand you in a way that no one else can. They are a blessing from heaven. Can you imagine just how dull life would be without your friend? Cherish that beautiful bond by sending them love-filled caring messages. Don’t be stingy. Tell them how much you love them. Below, we dedicate some heart-touching messages and wishes to friends about friendship.</p>

<p>A single candle can illuminate an entire room. But a true friend lights up an entire lifetime. Thanks for the bright lighting up my life.</p>

<p>I will always treasure you because I know I will never have another friend like you. Love you.</p>
