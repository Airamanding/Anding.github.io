<h3>I hope you'll remember me. I hope my discipline made you stronger. I hope my kindness made you feel safe. I hope that my classroom was a place that you learned many things and made many friends; I hope it was a place you genuinely like to be.</h3>

<p>What I like about photographs is that they capture a moment that's gone forever, impossible to reproduce.</p>

<h3 id="laughing">Laughing</h3>
<p>It takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt you to the heart: the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you.</p>

<h3 id="love">Love</h3>
<p>It can be natural to develop romantic feelings for a close friend and not know whether to act on them. A romantic relationship with your best friend may be healthy and fulfilling, but it could also involve specific dynamic changes.</p>

<h3 id="tea share">Tea Share</h3>
<p>Tea with friends is like capturing happiness in a cup</p>

<h3 id="breathing">Breathing</h3>
<p>Finally, learning to breathe well is not an additive process in which you learn specific techniques for improving the breathing you already have. This can come later. It is more a deconstruction where you learn to identify the things you are already doing that restrict the natural flow of the breath.</p>
